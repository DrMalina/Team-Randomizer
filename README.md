# FIFA Randomizer

A simple project created as a React and Material UI practice.

On many occasions I used to play Fifa tournaments with my friends. Each time we were
choosing teams on random by drawing lots. This app is a digital upgrade of that mechanism.

Firstly, user has to type each participant name and add teams (some defaults are on). Next, the pair
of user+team is created randomly.

This is a silly little web app with no fancy functions or advanced logic. My main goal was to experiment and 
get a grasp of implementing Material UI to the projects.
